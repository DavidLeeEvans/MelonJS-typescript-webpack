# MelonJS Boilerplate

Having followed the [MelonJS](https://melonjs.org) tutorial on creating a 
[Platform](http://melonjs.github.io/tutorial-platformer/) game, I searched for an alternative
boilerplate template that supported typescript and webpack. There was an 
[ES6 setup example](https://gist.github.com/rvanzon/ccfb86c2fff3e31899fb) that was a good
starting point, but is incomplete so I've pulled this one together.
